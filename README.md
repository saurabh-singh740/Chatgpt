🌌 Aurora – Your Intelligent Conversational AI Assistant
💫 Overview

Aurora is a next-generation conversational AI system built to provide human-like, context-aware, and memory-driven interactions.
Unlike standard chatbots, Aurora integrates RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Vector Database (Pinecone), and Memory Architecture (STM + LTM) to understand, remember, and evolve with every conversation — all in real-time using Socket.io.

⚡ Key Features

🧠 Contextual Conversations – Retains short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) context for natural, continuous chats.

📚 RAG-Powered Responses – Combines AI generation with factual data retrieval from your own knowledge base.

🔍 Vector Search (Pinecone) – Stores embeddings and fetches semantically similar responses instantly.

💬 Real-Time Messaging – Smooth two-way chat experience using Socket.io.

🧩 Modular Architecture – Plug-and-play design for future integrations (voice, multi-agent, etc.).

🎨 Modern UI – Elegant React interface inspired by futuristic design principles.

🔒 Secure Data Handling – Uses environment variables for API keys and token safety.
